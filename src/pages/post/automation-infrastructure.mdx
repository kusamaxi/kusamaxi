# Designing automation infrastructure for running blockchain endpoints

## Introduction
DotInfra is a powerful automation tool designed to simplify the process of setting up and managing blockchain endpoints.
In this article, we will explore the features of DotInfra and how it can help you to streamline your infrastructure management.
DotInfra uses ansible to provision and manage your infrastructure.

## Features
DotInfra is a comprehensive infrastructure automation tool that offers a range of powerful features to help you manage your blockchain endpoints with ease. Some of its key features include:

- **Frontend**** - DotInfra also comes with a frontend for deploying and managing your infrastructure, providing you with a user-friendly interface that simplifies the process of managing your blockchain endpoints.
- **Image Building** - DotInfra can also build custom images using Packer, providing you with a streamlined process for creating and deploying images across your infrastructure.
- **Installer** - Easy to execute installer that creates virtual environment, install dependencies, and setup SSH-configs and agentforwarding.
- **PAM-Auth** - Enable passwordless authentication using u2fpam with u2f-key.
- **LXC-Containers** - DotInfra supports the installation of host machines with multiple LXC-Containers, making it easy to run multiple RPC endpoints.
- **Monitoring** - With DotInfra, you can easily monitor your infrastructure using a range of powerful tools, including Zabbix, Prometheus, and Grafana.
- **Polkacli** - DotInfra includes Polkacli, a CLI tool for managing Polkadot and Kusama nodes, making it easy to manage and monitor your blockchain endpoints.
- **Port Forwarding** - You can enable port forwarding for your LXC-Containers using DotInfra, allowing you to easily access your endpoints from other machines.
- **Provisioning** - With DotInfra, you can quickly provision your infrastructure based on your inventory, ensuring that your resources are allocated efficiently and effectively.
- **Reverse Proxy** - To provide a seamless user experience, DotInfra can enable reverse proxy for your LXC-Containers endpoints, ensuring that your users can access your blockchain endpoints easily and securely.
- **Seamless updates** - Updating your blockchain should be a seamless process where another container is created with the new client version and migration is done by changing sessionkey().
- **SSH Configs** - DotInfra can generate SSH configs based on your inventory, as well as add SSH agent service for agentforwarding to enable easy rsyncing between machines.
- **Snapshots**** - DotInfra enables you to take snapshots of your LXC-Containers and make those snapshots publicly available through Nginx, providing you with a reliable backup solution.
