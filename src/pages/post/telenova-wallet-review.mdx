## Did Telenova Wallet Solve the UX Problem Of Crypto?

The [source code](https://github.com/novasamatech/telenova-web-app/blob/dev/src/common/wallet/store.ts) for
[Telenova Wallet](https://t.me/telenova_app_bot) has been released, marking its true release date in our opinion.
Without the ability to review and authenticate the wallet's source code, users cannot be certain that they are the
sole holders of their keys. Transparency in the source code is crucial for verifying the security claims of any wallet
and ensuring that no hidden vulnerabilities or backdoors exist.

Telenova Wallet employs advanced cryptographic techniques to secure user assets. It uses a combination of AES encryption and the
Scrypt key derivation function to protect the mnemonic phrase, which serves as the foundation for generating key pairs. By deriving
a unique encryption key from the user's password and a random salt, the wallet ensures that the mnemonic remains secure even if the
encrypted data is exposed.

The encryption process involves generating a random salt and using the Scrypt algorithm to derive a key from the user's password
and the salt. This key is then used to encrypt the mnemonic with AES in CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) mode. The encrypted mnemonic
and salt are stored together securely. When the mnemonic needs to be decrypted, the salt is extracted, and the key is derived
again from the user's password to decrypt the mnemonic.

The wallet efficiently manages cryptographic keys by generating and securely storing the mnemonic phrase and associated key pairs.
The mnemonic is encrypted and stored locally, with an option for backup in Telegram Cloud Storage. This dual-storage approach offers
both convenience and security, allowing users to easily recover their wallets while keeping their private keys protected.

Designed with user-friendliness in mind, Telenova simplifies the onboarding process, requiring just two clicks to create an account
and be ready to send and receive transactions. This streamlined experience makes it accessible for new users while maintaining strong
security measures. The use of secure local storage and unique store names based on the user’s Telegram ID ensures that access remains
secure and conflict-free.

Telenova Wallet is particularly suitable for managing small to medium-sized amounts, such as a monthly salary or day-to-day expenses.
The key security factor is the strength of the user’s password, making it crucial to choose one that is robust and unique. A long,
complex password with a mix of letters, numbers, and special characters can greatly enhance security. This design reflects a deliberate
balance between user experience and security, enabling Web2 users to transition to Web3 without needing to understand and manage key pairs.
However, with the rise of LLM-powered password crackers that exploit extensive personal data, the reliability of passwords alone is becoming
questionable. For managing larger amounts, using an offline wallet setup is recommended, as detailed in
[this guide](https://kusamaxi.com/post/robust-vault-wallets), to ensure maximum security. Ultimately, Telenova users can control their security
level by opting for more complex passwords, thereby safeguarding their assets from potential threats.

The only critique we can give is that future enhancements could include consolidating all assets into an asset hub and providing
a teleport option for old users' assets still located on relaychains. Node selection for RPC endpoint seems also unoptimized leading
somewhat somewhat dragged down UX. It could have been better option to leverage the new polkadot-api js-library instead of the old
allowing for use of light clients for more secure and faster interactions with the underlying blockchains.
Straightforward improvement would be to prioritize low latency RPC endpoints by utilizing IBP/Dotters GeoDNS.

Overall [Telenova Wallet](https://t.me/telenova_app_bot) stands out as a reliable and user-friendly solution for cryptocurrency management.
Its robust encryption, efficient key management, and simple user interface make it an optimal choice for everyday transactions
and entry-level amounts, providing a smooth and secure experience for all users. After reviewing the source code and evaluating
the cryptographic scheme, we can highly recommend considering Telenova Wallet for onboarding your friends into crypto by gifting
them some KSM or USDT using Telenova.
