## Securing Your Assets with Parity Vault


In today's rapidly changing world of cryptocurrencies and blockchain, the
security of digital assets is critical. Wallets, which bridge the gap between
users and their funds, are essential to this security framework. While many
wallets offer a range of features, sometimes less is more. Focusing on a single
core function can actually boost security. That's where the Parity Wallet
stands out â€” it has one main job: to protect your assets. This article provides
a detailed guide on how to best secure your cryptocurrency using a
security-centric approach.

1. **Hardware Preparations:** 
   - Acquire a Google Pixel 4a or a subsequent model. Pixel devices with
	 GrapheneOS have been designed with an array of [security
	 features](https://grapheneos.org/features), including hardware-backed
	 keystores and a hardened memory allocator.
   - On your Pixel device, install
	 [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/install). It's an open-source mobile
	 OS optimized for security and privacy, with features like the hardened
	 malloc implementation and extensive hardening of the base system and
	 bundled apps.

2. **Parity Wallet Deployment:**
   - Utilizing the sandboxed environment of the Google Play Store on
	 GrapheneOS, download the Parity Wallet. This isolation ensures minimal
	 risk to the primary OS.
   - Remember, the wallet's primary function is security, which requires a
	 stripped-down, laser-focused environment.

3. **Communication Lockdown:** 
   - Enable airplane mode, severing all communication, including Wi-Fi,
	 Bluetooth, and cellular.
   - It's imperative to maintain this state. In the context of security, an
	 air-gapped device introduces barriers to potential external threats.

4. **Configuration of the Parity Wallet:** 
   - Initialize the Parity Wallet application.
   - Initiate the process to create a new wallet. This encrypted digital
	 envelope will act as the guardian of your assets.
   - Backup the wallet seed phrase in a secure location. The correct way
	 of updating air-gapped wallet requires full reinstallation of GrapheneOS
	 and Parity Wallet. Therefore, it's crucial to have a secure backup of the
	 seed phrase.

5. **Integration with Polkadot.js:** 
   - On a separate secure computing environment, navigate to
	 [polkadot.js.org/apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps).
   - Create [a pure proxy
	 account](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-proxies) for your Parity
	 Wallet. As elucidated in the Polkadot documentation, proxies act as a
	 secondary protective layer, enabling certain functionalities without
	 exposing the primary account's assets. This modular security approach
	 minimizes risk by segregating roles and responsibilities. The pure proxy
	 also enables selling the account to new owner in secure manner.

6. **Maintenance and Updating Protocols:** 
   - Just as in the world of software engineering, version control and updates
	 are crucial to the health of a digital wallet.
   - Metadata of the wallet can be updated in air-gapped manner by reading QR
	 code with the Parity Wallet app [here](https://metadata.parity.io/).
   - When considering a wallet upgrade, a clean install approach is
	 recommended. Purging the previous version and deploying a fresh
	 installation eliminates residues and potential vulnerabilities. Detailed
	 procedures for this can be found within the official [Parity
	 documentation](https://paritytech.github.io/parity-signer/tutorials/Upgrading.html).

In summation, the fusion of state-of-the-art hardware (Pixel devices with
GrapheneOS) and meticulously crafted software (Parity Wallet) provides a
foundation of unparalleled security for your digital assets. By emphasizing
air-gapped operations, singular functionality, and rigorous update protocols,
users are poised to harness maximum security for their Polkadot assets.
Adapting to these practices not only enhances security but also instills
confidence in users, assuring them that their investments are guarded with the
utmost precision and care. As the decentralized space continues its exponential
growth, these methodologies will serve as benchmarks for secure digital asset
management, steering the community towards safer horizons.
