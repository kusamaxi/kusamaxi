## JAM Protocol: Key Updates and Refinements to the Graypaper

Since the release of the initial [JAM Protocol Graypaper](https://graypaper.com), Gav's team has
been hard at work refining and enhancing the protocol. For those curious about the developments
and improvements made since the original publication, we've compiled a comprehensive summary of
the key updates:

### Data Availability (DA) System
The DA system has been overhauled, now using 4104-byte segments
composed of 6 erasure coding pieces. This change optimizes erasure coding efficiency while
maintaining manageable segment sizes. A constant-depth Merkle tree for segment roots has been
introduced, balancing proof size and computation complexity. The system now separates short-term
Audit DA from long-term Imports DA, allowing for more flexible data retention policies.

### Work Package Enhancements
Work packages now use data commitments instead of inline data,
reducing package size and improving data handling efficiency. A new manifest system for imports,
exports, and extrinsics provides clearer data reference structures. A limit of 2048
imported/exported segments per package has been implemented to prevent potential DoS attacks while
maintaining high throughput.

### Guarantor Responsibilities
Guarantors now have expanded roles, including reconstructing
imported segments and generating paged proofs for exports. This increases system security by
ensuring data integrity at multiple points. The introduction of core affinity and
guarantor-to-guarantor distribution aims to improve network efficiency.

### Validator Statistics System
A new system tracks key metrics like block production, tickets,
preimages, guarantees, and assurances, providing a comprehensive view of validator performance.
These statistics are stored in the state and updated each epoch, allowing for trend analysis and
more effective incentive mechanisms.

### Cryptographic Improvements
Updates to erasure coding, Merklization, and shuffling procedures
show a commitment to using cutting-edge cryptographic techniques, potentially offering better
performance and security.

### IPv6-Only Support

In response to the global IPv4 address exhaustion, JAMSNP takes a forward-looking approach by
exclusively supporting IPv6. This decision aims to future-proof the protocol and promote wider
IPv6 adoption in the blockchain space.

### QUIC Protocol

All connections in JAMSNP are based on the QUIC protocol, which offers improved performance and
security compared to traditional TCP.

### Validator Connectivity

Validators are required to maintain connections with all other validators in both the current
and upcoming epochs. Validator endpoints are specified using IPv6/port combinations, ensuring
comprehensive network coverage.

### TLS 1.3 Encryption and Authentication

JAMSNP employs TLS 1.3 for connection encryption and peer authentication. The protocol mandates
specific requirements for X.509 certificates:

- Use of Ed25519 as the signature algorithm
- Certificates must use the peer's Ed25519 key (published on-chain for validators)
- A unique alternative name format for DNS

### Protocol Identification

The protocol uses QUIC/TLS ALPN (Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation) for version and chain
identification. The protocol identifier follows the format `jamnp-s/V/H`, where `V` is the protocol
version and `H` is derived from the chain's genesis header.

### Stream-Based Communication

JAMSNP utilizes QUIC streams for all communications, categorized into two types:

1. Unique Persistent streams: Long-lived streams for ongoing communication
2. Common Ephemeral streams: Short-lived streams for specific queries or data submissions

### Specialized Message Types

The protocol defines several specialized message types for various blockchain operations, including:

- Ticket submission
- Work Report publication
- Assurance publication
- Judgement publication
- Preimage publication
- Block publication
- Work Package submission and sharing
