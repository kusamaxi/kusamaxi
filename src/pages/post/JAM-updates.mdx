# JAM Protocol: Technical Updates and Network Architecture

Since the release of the initial JAM Protocol Graypaper, significant refinements have been made
to the protocol, particularly in its networking layer (JAMNP-S). In this article we do a
comprehensive overview of the key architectural changes to provide updates to those who read the
paper on its 0.1 version.

## Network Protocol Foundation: QUIC and TLS 1.3

The JAM network protocol builds on modern networking foundations:

### QUIC Protocol Base
All connections in JAMNP-S are based on QUIC, chosen for its performance and security advantages.
This provides a solid foundation for the protocol's stream-based architecture.

### Advanced Security with TLS 1.3
The protocol implements robust security through TLS 1.3 with specific requirements:
- Mandatory peer authentication through X.509 certificates
- Ed25519 signature algorithm requirement
- Certificates must use the peer's Ed25519 key (which must be published on-chain for validators)
- Specific DNS name format: 53-character name starting with "e" followed by base-32 encoded Ed25519 public key

## Network Architecture

### IPv6-First Design
JAMNP-S makes a forward-looking architectural choice by requiring IPv6 for all validator endpoints. Validator endpoints are specified through IPv6/port combinations, with addressing information stored in the first 18 bytes of validator metadata (16 bytes for IPv6 address, 2 bytes for port in little-endian format).

### Validator Connectivity Requirements
The protocol implements a sophisticated connectivity model:
- Validators must maintain connections with all validators from previous, current, and next epochs
- Connection initiation is determined by a deterministic "Preferred Initiator" algorithm based on Ed25519 public keys
- Reserved slots (approximately 20) are maintained for work-package builders
- Epoch transitions include a 2-minute buffer period plus finalization of the first block before applying connectivity changes

### Stream-Based Communication
All network communication occurs over QUIC streams, categorized into two types:

1. Unique Persistent (UP) Streams:
   - Single stream per connection
   - Typically long-lived
   - Opened by connection initiator
   - Used for ongoing communication like block announcements

2. Common Ephemeral (CE) Streams:
   - Multiple concurrent streams allowed
   - Short-lived for specific operations
   - Used for queries and data submission
   - Clear protocol for stream closure and error handling

## Protocol Features

### Block Distribution and State Access
- Efficient block announcement system using a grid structure for validator organization
- State request protocol allowing range-based state queries with size limits
- Work-report distribution system with guaranteed delivery confirmation

### Work Package Processing
- Dedicated protocols for work-package submission from builders to guarantors
- Work-package sharing between guarantors on the same core assignment
- Built-in verification steps before package sharing
- Support for bundle distribution and shard management

### Availability System
- Sophisticated shard distribution protocol for assurers
- Audit shard request system for auditors
- Segment shard request protocols with optional verification
- Support for both immediate and delayed verification strategies

### Consensus and Validation
- Safrole ticket distribution system with proxy-based architecture
- Two-phase ticket distribution process with timing controls
- Comprehensive availability assurance system
- Audit announcement and judgment publication protocols

## Protocol Identification

JAMNP-S uses ALPN (Application Layer Protocol Negotiation) for protocol identification:
- Format: `jamnp-s/V/H` or `jamnp-s/V/H/builder`
- V: Protocol version (currently 0)
- H: First 8 nibbles of chain's genesis header hash
- Special builder suffix for work-package builder connections

## Message Format Standardization

All stream protocols use a consistent message format:
- Size prefix: 32-bit little-endian unsigned integer
- Content follows size specification
- Clear protocol for message boundaries and stream termination

This refined architecture demonstrates significant evolution from the original Graypaper,
with particular attention to network security, efficiency, and scalability. The protocol provides
a robust foundation for JAM's distributed consensus and computation systems.
